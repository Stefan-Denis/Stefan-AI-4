# Stefan AI 4

Whilst Stefan AI 3 was decent, it was too hard to create output videos that got tons of success. 

I have come to the conclusion that there must be some manual work done in each video. The AI could not get a good hook for the video, it lacked understanding of human emotions and how dopamine worked. It had a washed-up version of how everything worked, from a leftist persepctive.

This is why Stefan AI 4 will use a "modules system" so that functionality can expand. Since no one will have access to this app, it does not demand a complex UI made in React, it can work fine with WinForms and CLI interfaces.

The app have at its core, as I have said earlier, a module system. Each module has its own folder directory in which it works in, and will be managed by the system.

## Dependencies

* C++ desktop development package from Visual Studio 2022
* MFA
* Python
* Miniconda
* FFMpeg
* NodeJS

(These tools will come included with the app, and will have installation scripts)

## Version Control and packages.

There will be 2 versions of this app made. One where it relies on NPM, and one complete version kept safe, in case a package dissapears off of NPM or something happens to MFA.
